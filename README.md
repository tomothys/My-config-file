# My neovim config

# ToDos
* [x] Configure __which-keys__
* [x] Add WhichKey Mappings for Git related stuff
* [ ] Remove Terminal-Toggle for LazyGit. Or just revert back to <Space>tt. Pretty annoying if you wanna write a commit message with <Space>t and it closes LazyGit mid-sentence.
* [ ] Add a key mapping that opens a global-notes.md file for rapid note taking. If file doesn't exists that key mapping should create it.
* [ ] ~~Consider vim-rooter. Something is always changing the root directory and that's annoying as hell~~  I think I found the culprit. It was Startify I guess.
* [ ] Replace GitGutter with Signify
* [ ] Style LspSaga
* [ ] Write a ReadMe
* [ ] lua-fy my neovim configuration
* [ ] Find a way to automatically install vim-plug and PlugInstall without it throwing hundreds and thousands of errors
* [ ] Write own colorscheme based on NVCode to make colorscheme overwrites obsolete
